      I am Shanaka Rusith. I like to learn new things and do experiments. I write some of them in this blog.
      <br>
      Professionally, I am a software engineer living in Sri Lanka with 3+ years of experience. Currently working as a full-stack engineer.
      <br>
      I like reading (<a href="http://goodreads.com/rusith" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>), watching films (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81064939/" target="_blank">Imdb</a>). I like to read non-fiction especially Business Philosophy and Psychology books. and enjoy watching good films especially old ones.
